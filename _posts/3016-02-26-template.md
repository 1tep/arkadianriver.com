## Required

### `title`

Title for `<title/>` and `<h1/>`. For this and all other fields refer to Yaml
restrictions on when you need to quote the value.

{% highlight yaml %}
title: My interesting topic
{% endhighlight %}

### `excerpt`

Recommended to provide an excerpt in front-matter, because _in-body_ extraction
has too many caveats. Truncated as necessary in references, so it can be as long
as you want. But, also displayed, centered, right under the topic title (in
all caps in original style).

{% highlight yaml %}
excerpt: yada yada
{% endhighlight %}

### `categories`

*IF* it's a blog post, the categories array is required with at least the first
element set to the permalink name of its parent page (so that breadcrumbs
work). If there are more categories, create a parent for that category
to act just as a page would, with a permalink and a loop through its kids
or pagination. Breadcrumb and site permalink is:
`/category1(e.g. topics)/category2/.../title.html`
Category list can be space-delimited on one line or a bulleted list.

{% highlight yaml %}
categories: topics ...
{% endhighlight %}

### `permalink`

*IF* parent page, use permalink for it's new category, but don't specify
that new category for this parent page itself, because it becomes the index
that a breadcrumb link would pop up to, ie: `/new-category/index.html`

{% highlight yaml %}
permalink: /new-category/
{% endhighlight %}

## Optional

### `options`

The options allow you to customize the page somewhat.

{% highlight yaml %}
options:
  - minihead      # as minimal a title as possible, and no date printed
  - fullwidth     # leaving only a very tiny margin
  - nocomment     # disable disqus comments for this post
  - nomenu        # for pages, don't add to the menu
  - nolanding     # for pages and featured posts, don't add to the landing page
{% endhighlight %}

### `layout`

If you're writing a post, put in `_posts` folder; no need to set layout.
If you're writing a page, put in `_pages` folder; no need to set layout.
But, do still set the category.
Specifying the layout is optional because defaults
are set in the `_config.yml` to set the layout based on the folder it's in.
You can override, however.

{% highlight yaml %}
layout: {page|post}
{% endhighlight %}

### `background-image`

If you want a larger title block with a background image, put the image in the
images folder and specify it here. Use a high resolution image, if possible,
for when viewed full screen.

{% highlight yaml %}
background-image: imagefile.png
{% endhighlight %}

### `tags`

For _topics_ posts, the only tag that has an effect right now is `featured`,
which changes its display in the `/topics/` page. The most recent eight
featured posts are also added to the main landing page.

{% highlight yaml %}
tags: featured
{% endhighlight %}

For _works_ posts, the tags become a listing of skills demonstrated. For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
tags:
  - C
  - Windows DLL
  - SGML
{% endhighlight %}

![web page display of the preceding tags]({{ '/images/skills.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

### `icon`

For the featured articles on the main page, if you want an icon other than
the heart icon, specify the `font-awesome` icon identifier.
See the [font-awesome icons]({{ '/topics/icons.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
topic for a list of available icons.

{% highlight yaml %}
icon: envelope-o
{% endhighlight %}

### `author`

If you want the article to be attributed to an author, specify a name that
corresponds to a key in the `_data\authors.yml` file.

{% highlight yaml %}
author: key_name
{% endhighlight %}


## CSS and Script support

### `includes`

If your page needs to include stylesheets or scripts, provide 'em as either
local or remote URLs. Prefix remote urls with `//`, not `http`. Stylesheets
are included in the header, and scripts at the bottom before the body closes.

{% highlight yaml %}
style-includes:
  - /local/path/to/stylesheet.css
  - //remote.com/url/to/stylesheet.css
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yaml %}
script-includes:
  - /local/path/to/script.js
  - //remote.com/url/to/script.js
{% endhighlight %}

### `style, script`

You can embed styles and scripts, too. Use the yaml `|` indented block to
ensure line breaks are preserved. Styles output in header below stylesheet
includes, scripts at bottom underneath script includes.

{% highlight yaml %}
style: |
  /* some css block here */
  .some-class {
    somestyle: definition;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yaml %}
script: |
  // some script block here...
  $(document).ready(function(){
    ...
  });
{% endhighlight %}
